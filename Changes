          - construction with an invalid document is handled more nicely
          - added new dialect schema share/strict-schema.json to the list of
            available schemas, which prohibits unrecognized keywords
          - added custom LICENSE to schema files copied from
            github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification
          - distribution is renamed from JSON-Schema-Modern-Document-OpenAPI
            to OpenAPI-Modern

0.021     2022-02-11 04:44:05Z
          - absolute locations in errors are now resolved against the
            request's Host header

0.020     2022-02-10 02:56:46Z
          - validation methods and find_path now also accept the HTTP request
            method as an option
          - the request object is no longer required as an argument to
            find_path
          - validate_request, validate_response now also support Mojolicious
            request and response objects

0.019     2022-01-23 08:17:30Z
          - some instanceLocations in errors from validate_request and
            validate_response have changed to be more specific regarding the
            source of the error
          - find_path is now a public method of OpenAPI::Modern, factored out
            of validate_request and validate_response to enable third-party
            callers to reuse information between these two method calls

0.018     2022-01-17 23:37:05Z
          - fix parsing of escaped characters in URI paths and capture values

          - remove erroneous logic when checking the "discriminator" keyword
          - user-provided path_template, path_captures and operation_id are
            all verified against the request URI
          - path_template, operation_id and path_captures are no longer
            required arguments for validate_request, validate_response

0.014     2021-12-30 05:38:03Z
          - use bignums in JSON::Schema::Modern to properly support int32,

0.013     2021-12-22 19:23:30Z
          - support */* as a media-type in a content specification, to
            indicate valiation checks that can be performed on any content
            type (e.g. length)
          - add support for OAS-specific formats: int32, int64, float, double,
            password

0.012     2021-12-17 06:39:38Z
          - properly handle a missing Content-Length header alongside a

          - spurious validation errors fixed when request body is empty,

          - OpenAPI metaschemas are now also available via URIs ending in
            .../latest
          - improved error messaging when a media-type or charset decoder fails
          - improved handling of HTTP headers

0.009     2021-12-06 05:55:01Z
          - validation no longer errors on a missing media type if the
            corresponding schema is empty (true)
          - validate_request and validate_response now accept an operation_id
            instead of a path_template for looking up the endpoint
            specification in the openapi document
          - treat Content-Type headers and media-type entries in openapi
            documents case-insensitively, and also match wildcards
            (image/jpg falls back to image/* or */*)

0.008     2021-12-03 05:33:29Z

0.004     2021-11-28 22:09:01Z
          - implemented validate_response()
          - when validating requests and responses, values that look like
            numbers, and are evaluated as numbers in schemas, are now coerced
            to numbers automatically

0.003     2021-11-26 01:01:47Z
